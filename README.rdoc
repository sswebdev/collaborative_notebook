== NOTEBOOK

Within this app, we are going to practice managing a CRUD resource -- only this time, with Ajax rather than with traditional HTML request/response.

#### Killing leftover processes

Example below assumes port used is 9292:

    lsof -i :9292

This gives you the pid of the process, say 34564, then kill it with:

    kill -9 34564

If you are on windows, install cygwin to get lsof and kill commands.
